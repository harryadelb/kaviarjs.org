**Kaviar** is a framework of predefined modern JavaScript technologies (Meteor, Apollo, React) that allow you to build Web & Mobile apps rapidly. Our main focuses are: Code Scalability, Developer Experience, Code Elegance.

---

## What will I learn?

We will learn how to build rock-solid backends (usable by mobile as well), beautiful well-structured frontends, everything in an organised fashion.

This means we provide folder structure, development patterns, interesting tools you can use to accelerate your development time and quality, you will have the ability to design complex well-tested apps and implement them with ease by following Kaviar's conventions.

It's a journey, and there are a lot of new concepts, but we, the [Cult of Coders](https://www.cultofcoders.com), hope that you will enjoy our work!

## What do I need before I begin?
