In this page, we will show examples and link to resources for you to understand the basics of GraphQL usage:
- Type Definitions
- Queries & Mutations
- Arguments

Please go through https://graphql.org/learn/ to understand the basics. Because we're developers and we don't want to re-invent the wheel, I will assume from now on that you have read it at least once.

## Mutation vs Query

For GraphQL, in essence, there is really no difference, you can use queries to make changes to your remote state, but it is an important distinction that helps developers use the API. An easy way to put it:

**Query** = Fetching data *without* altering server's state

**Mutation** = Action which *may* alter server's state

Now, if you like to dig a lil' bit deeper into this definition. You may ask, what if I want to fetch data, but also increase a counter somewhere, that I fetched this data X times? Is my query still a query or is it a mutation? Our assumption is that it matters how the client perceives it.


```js
// file: src/modules/core/index.js
import { load } from 'graphql-load';

load({
  typeDefs: `
    type Query {
      sayHello: String
    }
  `
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      sayHello: () => 'Hello world!'
    }
  }
});
```

When we define our GraphQL API we have to define the way it looks via type definitions, and the way it behaves, via resolvers.

Using `load` function we are able to load multiple types, queries and resolvers that get automatically merged together, it's an easy and simple way to do it. You can also use `load` to load just typeDefs or just resolvers. [Read more about grapqhl-load here](https://github.com/cult-of-coders/graphql-load).

Let us help you wrap your mind around this with more examples:

Types:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  name: String
  age: Int
  nameAndAge: String
}
```

Resolvers:

```js
{
  Query: {
    me() {
      // We're mocking a user here, as if it was returned from the database
      return {
        name: 'Theodor',
        age: -1, // I'm timeless
      }
    }
  },
  User: {
    nameAndAge(user) {
      return `${user.name} ${user.age}`;
    }
  }
}
```

Query:

```graphql
query {
  me {
    name
    age
    nameAndAge
  }
}
```

So you see some similarities between defining queries and actual types. That's because there's really no difference in defining it. It's just the main `Query` type is the one that gets interrogated when you use `query` in the GraphQL request. Same logic applies to main `Mutation` type.

## Arguments & Variables

Take a look and explore how to pass-in arguments:

- https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/

If we would like to create a mutation. Something which we save in the database:

Types:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  insertPost(post: PostInsertInput): String
}

input PostInsertInput {
  title: String!
  description: String!
}
```

Resolvers:

```js
{
  Mutation: {
    insertPost(_, args) {
      const { post } = args; // post has the form {title, description}
      console.log(post);
      // Do some action in the database
      return 'ok';
    }
  }
}
```

Query:

```js
mutation insertPost($post: PostInsertInput) {
  insertPost(post:$post)
}
```

Query Variables:

```js
{
  "post": {
    "title": "Hello",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum..."
  }
}
```

You can apply the same logic for arguments when you query for data.


## Exercises

1. Try to see how to define and return an array of elements of type `Integer` from a mutation. For example: `separateIntoPrimeFactors(n: Int!)`

2. For mutation instead of returning a string return a type of `MutationResponse` that contains status as `String` and errors as an array of `String`.

3. Try to create types and resolvers that would return something meaningful for this query:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    title
    description
    isPublished
    comments {
      text
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. How would you specify that a field is an `array`, that contains minimum 1 element of type `String`?

5. Create a query that returns the same message you passed:

```graphql
query {
  echo(message:"Is anybody out there?")
}
```

6. Try to pass an argument to a subquery like this.

```graphql
query {
  me {
    fullName(withPrefix: true)
  }
}
```

And you can just return something different if `withPrefix` is true or false, doesn't matter. Be creative.

7. Create a [fragment](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments). And use it.
